# Indexer Resync / Redeployment Runbook

This runbook covers operational incidents where the AudioBlock indexer worker
needs to be resynced or redeployed: a lagging indexer, a crashed worker, a
contract redeployment on a new address, or a database reset. For **historical
backfill** of pre-indexer data, see
[indexer-backfill-runbook.md](./indexer-backfill-runbook.md).

## 1. Catch-up resync (indexer is running but lagging)

**Symptoms:**
- Grafana alert: `IndexerLagHigh` — `indexer_lag_ledgers > 1000` for 5+ minutes
- `GET /api/admin/indexer/status` shows `lagLedgers > 1000`
- RPC latency is normal (P95 < 5s)

**Cause:** Usually a temporary RPC provider slowdown, a deploy that paused the
worker, or a burst of on-chain activity.

**Resolution:**

```bash
# 1. Check current lag per contract
GET /api/admin/indexer/status

# 2. Check worker logs for errors
docker logs audioblock_indexer --tail 100 --follow
# or on Kubernetes:
kubectl logs deployment/indexer --tail=100 -f

# 3. If no errors — the worker is catching up on its own.
#    Wait 10–15 minutes and re-check the Grafana lag panel.
#    Normal catch-up speed is ~200 ledgers/second with batch-size 100.

# 4. If errors are present (e.g. RPC timeouts), check the RPC endpoint:
curl -X POST $SOROBAN_RPC_URL_MAINNET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}'
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}

# 5. If the RPC is healthy but lag is not recovering after 30 minutes,
#    restart the worker to clear any stalled poll loops:
docker restart audioblock_indexer
# or:
kubectl rollout restart deployment/indexer
```

**Expected outcome:** Lag drops back below 100 ledgers within 10–30 minutes
after the worker resumes normal polling.

---

## 2. Worker restart after crash

**Symptoms:**
- Grafana alert: `IndexerLagHigh` sustained
- Worker pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff` or container has exited
- `GET /api/admin/indexer/status` times out or returns 503

**Cause:** OOM kill, uncaught exception, or infrastructure fault.

**Resolution:**

```bash
# 1. Check exit code and last logs
docker inspect audioblock_indexer --format '{{.State.ExitCode}}'
docker logs audioblock_indexer --tail 200

# On Kubernetes:
kubectl describe pod -l app=indexer
kubectl logs -l app=indexer --previous

# 2. If OOM (exit code 137):
#    - Increase memory limit in docker-compose.prod.yml or the k8s Deployment.
#    - Reduce INDEXER_BATCH_SIZE (default 100 → 50) to lower per-batch memory.

# 3. Restart the worker
docker start audioblock_indexer
# or:
kubectl rollout restart deployment/indexer

# 4. Verify cursor integrity — the worker should resume from the last
#    committed cursor, not from ledger 0.
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT contract_id, network, last_processed_ledger, error_count, last_error
  FROM indexer_cursors
  ORDER BY updated_at DESC;"
```

**Cursor is safe:** The worker only advances `last_processed_ledger` after a
batch is fully persisted. A crash mid-batch re-processes the same batch on
restart (events are upserted, so duplicates are harmless).

---

## 3. Contract redeployed to a new address

**Symptoms:**
- A Soroban contract was redeployed (new contract ID)
- Old contract address no longer emitting events
- `GET /api/admin/indexer/status` shows the old contract stuck at the
  deployment ledger of the new one

**Resolution:**

```bash
# 1. Update environment variables with the new contract ID
#    In .env / Kubernetes secret / ECS task definition:
SONG_FACET_MAINNET_CONTRACT_ID=<NEW_CONTRACT_ID>

# 2. Optionally reset the cursor for the old contract so the indexer
#    does not keep polling a dead address:
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  DELETE FROM indexer_cursors
  WHERE contract_id = '<OLD_CONTRACT_ID>'
  AND network = 'mainnet';"

# 3. Redeploy the indexer worker so it picks up the new env var.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps indexer
# or:
kubectl rollout restart deployment/indexer

# 4. If the new contract has events from before the indexer start ledger,
#    run a backfill for the gap:
npm run cli -- backfill:run \
  --contract <NEW_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network mainnet \
  --start <DEPLOYMENT_LEDGER> \
  --end <CURRENT_LEDGER>
```

---

## 4. Cursor recovery after database reset

**Symptoms:**
- Database was wiped or `indexer_cursors` table was truncated
- Worker restarts from ledger 0 and is processing millions of historical ledgers
- `indexed_events` table is being flooded with old events

**Resolution (fastest — skip historical events):**

```bash
# 1. Stop the indexer immediately to avoid unnecessary RPC calls
docker stop audioblock_indexer
# or:
kubectl scale deployment/indexer --replicas=0

# 2. Find the current ledger sequence on each network
curl -s -X POST https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getLatestLedger"}' \
  | jq '.result.sequence'

curl -s -X POST https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getLatestLedger"}' \
  | jq '.result.sequence'

# 3. Pre-seed cursors to the current ledger so the worker starts
#    from "now" instead of replaying all history.
#    Adjust CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET and CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET from step 2.
psql $DATABASE_URL <<'SQL'
INSERT INTO indexer_cursors
  (id, contract_id, network, last_processed_ledger, events_processed, error_count)
VALUES
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ARTIST_MAINNET_ID>',      'mainnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<SONG_MAINNET_ID>',        'mainnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ALBUM_MAINNET_ID>',       'mainnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<MARKETPLACE_MAINNET_ID>', 'mainnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ROYALTY_MAINNET_ID>',     'mainnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_MAINNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ARTIST_TESTNET_ID>',      'testnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<SONG_TESTNET_ID>',        'testnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ALBUM_TESTNET_ID>',       'testnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<MARKETPLACE_TESTNET_ID>', 'testnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET, 0, 0),
  (gen_random_uuid(), '<ROYALTY_TESTNET_ID>',     'testnet', CURRENT_LEDGER_TESTNET, 0, 0)
ON CONFLICT (contract_id, network) DO UPDATE
  SET last_processed_ledger = EXCLUDED.last_processed_ledger,
      events_processed = 0,
      error_count = 0,
      updated_at = NOW();
SQL

# 4. Start the indexer
docker start audioblock_indexer
# or:
kubectl scale deployment/indexer --replicas=1

# 5. If historical data is also needed, run the backfill separately
#    (see indexer-backfill-runbook.md) after the worker is stable.
```

## 5. Safe rolling redeployment procedure

Follow this order to avoid duplicate-event spikes or cursor corruption during
a planned deploy.

```
1. Send SIGTERM to the running worker
         │
         │   Worker finishes current batch and persists cursor
         │   (takes up to ~30s for a 100-event batch)
         ▼
2. Verify clean shutdown
         │
         │   Check logs for: "Indexer worker shutdown complete"
         │   or wait for container exit code 0
         ▼
3. Deploy the new worker image
         │
         │   docker-compose pull indexer && docker-compose up -d indexer
         │   or: kubectl set image deployment/indexer indexer=<NEW_IMAGE>
         ▼
4. Verify the new worker resumes from the correct ledger
         │
         │   Check logs for the startup message showing last_processed_ledger
         │   Compare against psql: SELECT last_processed_ledger FROM indexer_cursors;
         ▼
5. Confirm lag is recovering on Grafana within 5 minutes
```

**What to avoid:**

- **Do not** `docker kill` (SIGKILL) — this skips the graceful shutdown and
  may leave the cursor behind by up to one batch.
- **Do not** run two worker instances simultaneously against the same database
  — parallel writes to `indexer_cursors` can cause cursor drift.
- **Do not** restart the worker while a backfill CLI command is in progress —
  both processes update the same `indexer_cursors` row.

---

## Verification checklist (post-incident)

After any resync or redeployment, confirm all of the following:

```bash
# 1. Lag is below 100 ledgers on all contracts
GET /api/admin/indexer/status

# 2. No error spike in the last 15 minutes
# Grafana: indexer_errors_total rate(5m) < 0.1

# 3. Cursors are advancing (run twice, 30s apart)
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT contract_id, network, last_processed_ledger, updated_at
  FROM indexer_cursors ORDER BY network, contract_id;"

# 4. Events are being written
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT network, contract_id, COUNT(*) AS events, MAX(created_at) AS latest
  FROM indexed_events
  GROUP BY network, contract_id
  ORDER BY latest DESC;"
```

---

## Escalation

If the indexer cannot recover after following this runbook:

1. Check [ADR-010](./adrs/010-indexer-architecture.md) for architecture context.
2. Check the Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:3001` (or the production URL).
3. Open an incident issue: https://github.com/AudioBitsStellar/AudioBlock_Backend/issues
4. For RPC provider issues, check the provider's status page and consider
   switching `SOROBAN_RPC_URL_MAINNET` to a backup endpoint.
