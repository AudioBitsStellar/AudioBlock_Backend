/**
 * Authentication mode feature flag (Issue #636).
 *
 * The Privy migration has to coexist with the existing email/password and
 * wallet-signature auth rather than replace it in one deploy. A single boolean
 * is not enough to express that: "Privy on" and "legacy off" as one toggle
 * means a bad Privy release logs everybody out, and there is no way to run both
 * at once to compare before committing. So the mode is an explicit enum:
 *
 * | AUTH_MODE  | legacy `requireAuth` | Privy `requireAuth` | Intended use                    |
 * | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
 * | `legacy`   | yes                  | no                 | default / pre-migration / rollback |
 * | `both`     | yes                  | yes                | staged rollout + shadow testing  |
 * | `privy`    | no                   | yes                | after legacy signups have drained  |
 *
 * Defaults to `legacy` (fail-safe): with no `AUTH_MODE` set the behaviour is
 * byte-for-byte what it was before this flag existed.
 *
 * `PRIVY_ALLOW_LEGACY_FALLBACK` is a separate, narrower switch. It only governs
 * what happens when Privy itself is unreachable (Issue #635) — a transport
 * failure or an open circuit breaker — and never a genuine rejection such as a
 * bad signature or an expired token. Failing *closed* on a bad token is a
 * security property, so it is not negotiable by this flag.
